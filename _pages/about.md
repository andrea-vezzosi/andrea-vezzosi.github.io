Hi! I’m Andrea Vezzosi, a postdoctoral fellow working in the [Laboratory of Computational Chemistry and Biochemistry (LCBC)](https://www.epfl.ch/labs/lcbc/), led by [Prof. Ursula Röthlisberger](https://www.epfl.ch/labs/lcbc/prof-ursula-rothlisberger/) at [EPFL](https://www.epfl.ch/en/), Switzerland.
I earned my PhD degree in Physics and Nanosciences from the University of Modena and Reggio Emilia, Italy, working on the electronic properties of semiconductor nanowires under the supervision of [Prof. Guido Goldoni](https://personale.unimore.it/rubrica/dettaglio/ggoldoni).
